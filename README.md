## Set up

To set up this project, first clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamesbting/fundmore-challenge.git
```

Change your working directory into the project directory

```bash
$ cd superhero-app
```

## Run

Install npm modules

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the application

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Dependencies

Before starting the application, you must install the following dependencies.
Dependencies: material-ui/core, material-ui/icons, lodash

To install material-ui, type the following into the command line:

```bash
npm install @material-ui/core
```

```bash
npm install @material-ui/icons
```

```bash
npm i --save lodash
```

In the Result.jsx file, (src\Components\Result\Result.jsx) ensure that the value in API_KEY is your API key

## Notes about the design

1. While the requirements imply that the superhero details and the team should be on different pages, when I used my own application and after thinking about it, since it is a team builder, I felt it would be better to show them on the same page, so the user will be able to compare the superheroes that were searched to the ones that are currently on the team

While this is probably against the requirements, in my opinion it would be better since the user will be able to see the differences between their team members and the search results, an important consideration for a team builder app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
